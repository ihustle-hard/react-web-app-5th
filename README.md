### Code of conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. Please read and respect the [WHATWG Code of Conduct](https://whatwg.org/code-of-conduct).

### Contribution opportunities

We appreciate all contributions, see the [guidelines for contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details, including information on how to build HTML output from the `source` file so you can preview your changes locally.

### Tests

Tests are in the `html/` directory of the [web-platform-tests repository](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt).

### Blame

As the `source` file is too large for [GitHub's blame utility](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/), use [blame for `source` on searchfox](https://searchfox.org/whatwg-html/source/source) instead.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Created my-app at /root/node_modules/my-app/my-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-app
  npm start
